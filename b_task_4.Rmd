## Task on slide 343



With the function you defined in `func_drug_conc.R`, run the drug concentration
model with `r2` taking values uniformly between 1/8 and 1/10, and plot the results.

```{r}

source("func/func_drug_conc.R")
r2 <- runif(1, 1/10, 1/8)
out <- deSolve::ode(
        y = c("x" = 1, "y" = 0), times = seq(1, 40, 0.01), func = func_drug_conc,
        parms = c("r1" = 1/3, "r2" = r2), method = "euler"
    )
    plot(x ~ time, data = out, type = "l")
    lines(y ~ time, data = out)

```

## Task on slide 343

With the function you defined in `func_drug_conc.R`, run the drug concentration
model with `r2` taking values uniformly between 1/8 and 1/10, and plot the results.

```{r}
source(file.path("func","func_drug_conc.R"))

r2_value <- seq(from = 1/8, to = 1/10, by = -0.005)

for(rr2 in r2_value){ 
    out <- deSolve::ode(
        y = c("x" = 1, "y" = 0), times = seq(1, 40, 0.01), func = func_drug_conc,
        parms = c("r1" = 1/2, "r2" = rr2), method = "euler"
    )
    plot(x ~ time, data = out, type = "l")
    lines(y ~ time, data = out)
}

```
